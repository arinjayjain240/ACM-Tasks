				<p>Agenda: <em>Abyssinian Crisis</em><br><br>The League of Nations was an international organisation created to maintain universal peace by investigating international issues, discussing the gravity of grave matters and striving to reach a solution to the conflicts through diplomatic pressure, imposition of sanctions, the authorisation of military force, and the assignment of peacekeeping forces and mediators. Its role was of paramount importance for the neutralisation of looming threats of violence and terror as to sustain peace in the world and it pledged to defend the territory and independence of any member attacked by another nation. 5th December 1934 saw the clash of Italian and Ethiopian troops in the WalWal oasis town on the disputed Ethiopian-Italian Somaliland frontier - where Italian forces in 1930, had moved 50-miles deep inside Ethiopian territory to build a fort, which the Abyssinian Empire insists, is a violation of the Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of Friendship of 1928. While the reasons for the start of this violent skirmish are unclear, Italy claims that the Abyssinian troops attacked their forces without reason, the Abyssinians, on the other hand, contend that the Italian and Somali forces were the ones to begin hostilities.<br><br>As of today, the Italian government has demanded an apology from the Ethiopian government along with financial remuneration and other reparations, claiming the incident and unwillingness of Abyssinia to take responsibility as casus belli. Could this clash well be the precursor for another Italo-Ethiopian war? Having faced a distasteful defeat at the hands of Abyssinia in 1896 in the Battle of Adua, during the Scramble for Africa, the avarice and malevolence of Italy seems to have reached its zenith under Mussolini, as their recent actions of building inroads into Ethiopian territory can well be categorised as an attempt to secure to themselves their share of Africa! Rampant maladministration, rudimentary defence forces and slavery in Ethiopia, have made Ethiopia perfect in the eyes of Italy for a white man's war of liberation-to further their imperialist designs and insatiable greed, under a fascist regime. Owing to these incidents, Abyssinia, under Haile Selassie has appealed to the League on 3rd January, 1935 under article XI of the Covenant of the LoN requesting a referral of the case to an arbitration scheme. Accordingly, the League of Nations is meant to meet and come up with a solution to the Abyssinian crisis, one which shall restore the League's damaged reputation and resolve the Italo-Ethiopian conflict once and for all.<br><br>Benito Mussolini had remarked - ‘The League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all, when eagles fall out’. The League’s failure to act decisively in the conflict exposed its powerlessness and contributed to the total loss of respect borne for it. With collective security at a risk of being reduced to a mere principle in theory and the danger of the Abyssinian Empire being reduced to a corridor of camels, our committee shall lay special emphasis on the Unanimity Rule principle which required every decision made by the Assembly and Council to be reached through consensus. Therefore, delegates must realise that they will only succeed in solving this crisis through solidarity and acting as a unified body to prove Mussolini otherwise!<br><br>Welcome to the League.</p>

				<p>Agenda: <em>The Gulf War of 1990</em><br><br>Set in a time when tensions ran high, and rivers of the Middle East threatened to run red, the Historic United Nations Security Council will be discussing the Gulf War of 1990.<br><br>In the words of Horace, <em>"In peace, a wise man prepares for war".</em><br><br>On the 2nd of August 1990, the Iraqi Republican Guard, led by Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait, alleging that Kuwait's oil production was surpassing its OPEC quota, was unlawfully drilling oil from the field of Rumalia, and should pardon Iraq's debts. Precipitated by fiery nationalistic rhetoric, the invasion of Kuwait constitutes an immediate threat to international peace and security, calling into action the United Nations Security Council, conferred with the responsibility of fulfilling its primary objective: to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. An objective often challenged by dynamic and constantly evolving geopolitical scenarios and alliances. A manifestation of the collective political will of the international community, this council must consider the far reaching economic, military and social consequences of the events of August the 2<sup>nd</sup>, if not to uphold the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that form the foundation of the United Nations, then to expostulate critics of the UNSC who claim that the indecisiveness and power dynamics of the council are an obstacle to any real, actionable change.<br><br>Additionally, this complex and multifaceted conflict confronts us with some of the greatest and most potent moral and ethical questions that drive the United Nations: what is the value of oil as a political and economic commodity? What role will foreign actors play in either ameliorating or exacerbating the conflict? On what basis will the United Nations Security Council be legitimised in intervening militarily, if at all? And finally, how must countries choose to align themselves in such conflicts, in order to further their own motives without collateral damage?<br><br>Beginning on August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1990, over the course of this committee, delegates will be challenged to the limits of their faculties to answer these questions, as we strive to restore the balance of power disturbed by the political and personal agendas of autocrats and shape the diplomatic wisdom that the  international community will rely upon for centuries to come. The power belongs to you, delegates, if only you're fast enough to use it correctly.</p>

				<br>
				<p>Agenda: <em>Expansion of NATO and Relations with Russia</em><br><br>Founded as a result of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the NATO is the largest and arguably the most powerful military alliance in the world. Since the time of its inception, initially comprising 12 founding members, NATO has expanded in terms of its size and currently comprises 28 members from both sides across the Atlantic- from the North American and the European Continent, with certain states still at present, declaring their intentions and aspirations of possessing NATO membership. Titled, as a heated topic to which there seems to be a lack of consensus inside the NATO, answer to the same must be sought immediately.<br><br>Approximately 20,000 military personnel are engaged in NATO missions around the world namely missions in Afghanistan, Kosovo, the Middle East which involves countering the deadly ISIS, the Mediterranean, the African Continent, and Ukraine among others. There is immense scope for future expansion in the regions where NATO can operate, for instance, in the Asian Pacific region. Delegates must come up with a comprehensive evaluation of ongoing missions and propose possible areas within which NATO can operate. Delegates must remember that expansion of NATO not only involves expansion in terms of members, but also expansion in terms of ongoing and future missions and allies of NATO.<br><br>Russia’s continued destabilizing pattern of military activities and aggressive rhetoric, which goes well beyond Ukraine, remains a major concern for NATO. Meanwhile, President-elect Trump has repeatedly issued irresponsible remarks regarding NATO, once even questioning the relevance of it. The friendly Trump-Putin relationship has made the top military and diplomatic figures in Europe fear of Trump's rhetoric could spell the end of basic elements of trans-Atlantic security doctrine and encourage Russia to repeat Ukraine-style interventions against Eastern European NATO members. NATO-Russia relations have been uncertain and unstable for more than two decades now. Increasing military actions of Russia along NATO’s borders continues to make the Euro-Atlantic security environment more unpredictable and unstable, creating tension between the two. Despite the intentions of NATO to build a partnership with Russia in order to bring about peaceful dialogue and coordination in their areas of common interest, malicious intentions and accusations on part of Russia, seem to render this peace process dilatory.<br><br>NATO has never found itself, as a cause of concern for the entire world, which also includes Russia; not now and not ever, and even later does not wish to pursue any conflicts or seek any confrontations. However, the same cannot be said for the Russian Army which otherwise is in the news for reasons that  do not really embody the principles of sovereignty. Thus, it is very crucial for the NATO to draw up a plan regarding the aspect of future relations with Russia. Additionally, delegates must research on NATO’s relations with the Asian countries as this particular aspect becomes extremely pertinent due to China’s position as an emerging superpower. China’s fast paced economic growth shares the credit with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization founded by China and Russia. Speculations are that this can be “NATO of the east”.<br><br>With Russia heading in the direction of military expansion it is important for NATO to build Asian alliances, meetings regarding which, specifically, security cooperation between NATO and Japan have already started taking place. NATO can also be seen as a peacemaker in the troubled lands of Afghanistan and it takes pride in having partners in Central Asia as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan among others.<br><br>The expansion of NATO, a dynamic and evolving process, poses no threat to the safety, sovereignty or security of any nation of the world, instead aims at creating peace and stability and intends to acquire support from maximum nations. Delegates must propose suitable measures and realistic solutions to diffuse the mounting tension. Delegates will have the challenging task of drafting plans and pondering over the expansion of the current plan of action and entry into NATO to different regions and states; deliberate upon future relations with Russia and prepare for contingency plans in case of nondiplomatic counter-responses from the same; and come up with further action points that would continue to make NATO a trustworthy organization like it always has been, thus extending its allies.<br><br>The time has come when we must review our strategies and plan for future actions to meet varied new challenges and finally sail the ship into a calm ocean.</p>

				<p>Agenda: <em>Securing the future of Iran in light of Black Friday</em><br><br>Trusted friends,<br><br>I write to you in times of grave peril. We have been plagued over the past decade by dangers concerning not only us, but the sanctity of our beloved nation. Six days ago, Tehran saw a calamity little like it has ever seen before, and in this moment, I place in your hands the responsibility of ensuring that no citizen of Iran ever has to bear witness to such an incident again.<br><br>Last year, we saw the beginning of an uprising; an uprising comprising different segments of society, spreading its way across Iran with the single goal of destroying every attempt at modernization I have ever made. They call me ‘a puppet of the West’ and say I do not have what it takes to rule this oasis of peace in the Middle East, but tell me, who better fit to rule than the foremost heir of Pahlavi? I have a vision; I aim to take this country to the pinnacle of its moral prestige and temporal power.<br><br>The international community is quick to form opinions, as always, but I will not let my prospects be dictated by the whims and fancies of outside powers. Although still in exile, Ayatollah Khomeini grows stronger by the day, and his presence is felt in every nook and corner of Iran. Seven hundred workers went on strike in an oil refinery in Tehran on the 9th, and the same happened on the 11th, with workers going on strike in five other cities. People have resorted to bloodshed, and even the silence is deafening. Khomeini has blown the effect of the tragedy of 8th September out of proportion, and is, once again, championing religion to be his key proponent in winning this undesired war. I know that one day, my people will realize the cost of sacrificing growth to religion. The two go hand in hand; one is not possible without the other, and as long as we embrace the modern opportunities open to us, there is no reason why we should give up our religion. Organizations like the National Front of Iran, the Tudeh Party, the Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas and the People's Mujahedin of Iran pose equal threats to Iran: each cause carnage in the places they are based in.<br><br>Each one of you has been chosen for a multitude of reasons, ranging from diplomacy to the ability to remain calm in times of chaos. I hope that you will maintain the standards I expect from each one of you and show immense competence in matters of negotiation and leadership. Knowledge of the political, social and economic structures of Iran will be imperative when contributing to discussion as will tolerance of the contrasting ideologies of the different people involved in this predicament. You will be expected to think, interpret and respond to situations under high pressure, and make judgements on matters concerning life and death, under time constraints. Together, I know, we can not only make Iran fly, but soar to the greatest heights seen by mankind.<br><br>You must remember, however, we are treading in dangerous waters. One wrong step can ruin everything<br><br>The responsibility of securing the future of Iran is now in your hands; use it well.<br><br>ا ارادتمند شم<br>Reza Shah</p>

				<p>Agenda: <em>Combating Illegal Drug Trade</em><br><br>The Commission on Narcotics and Drugs was established by ECOSOC in 1946 as the essential gathering required with global medication control settlements. At the point when non-state on-screen characters, for example, sedate cartels or resistance developments support themselves through opiates exchange, it is the obligation of the CND to make the resolutions that will hamper these gatherings' exercises.<br><br>Choices made by the CND have extensive outcomes, for example, influencing the basic leadership procedures of ECOSOC and the World Health Organization. The CND currently finds itself faced with an issue that concerns the international community as a whole.<br><br>Illegal drug trade has increased drastically, particularly due to the World Cup. We are at crossroads; our members must find a way to deal with this issue, while simultaneously keeping in mind the impli cations of the consequences our actions may have</p>

				<p>Agenda: <em>Open Agenda</em><br><br>The Summit of States is set in the early 20 th century Europe, April 1911 to be exact. This period is plagued with rising conflicts in political, social, economic and military spheres, with the lives of millions hanging in the balance. The equilibrium of power is ever changing with new economic and military alliances being signed every now and then. The past casts a heavy shadow on the future of Europe with confrontations which nearly led the world into the theatre of war, be it the Moroccan Crisis in 1905-06 or the Bosnia Crisis in 1908, the ever changing landscape threatens peace all around the world.<br><br>With the deployment of French Troops in Morocco or the strengthening of Serbian Nationalism in Austro-Hungarian territory, the impending is in peril with tensions running high in Europe with the prospect of War looming large on the horizon.<br><br>Hence, leaders of the World convene for a Summit of the Foremost States to discuss the political future of Europe and the World, and take steps which will eventually lead to either peace or continental annihilation.<br><br>The decisions made at this Summit will influence the civilized man for centuries to come.</p>

				<p><em>"The printing press is the greatest weapon in the armoury of the modern commander"</em> - T.E. Lawrence<br><br>The press had been considered the ‘Fourth Estate’ since the time of the Ancient Regime in France; it illustrates how the power of the press can change society independently. The International Press is a staple of any UN Conference, as it relays the topics discussed to the general public, in an unbiased and lucid manner. It is the bridge between states and the people.<br><br>The press has the power to influence the minds of the people, and is both, instrumental and indispensable for good governance. They are the channels through which information reaches the citizens, and it is their responsibility to protect the people- protect them by bringing to light the cavities plaguing society which are too small to notice, but big enough to be of consequence.<br><br>Sanskriti’s UN simulation this year has plans to, as always, make the best of the orators, writers and researchers in you, and promote the knowledge of global affairs. The reporters that work in the International Press have the responsibility of showcasing the difficult decisions and intense debate that goes on in committee, while the cartoonists and photographers need to paint pictures which tell stories in themselves.<br><br>Remember, you are more than your allotted news agency; you are a member of the International Press. Your words and actions will impact real life scenarios, and possibly alter them too.</p>

				<p>Agenda: <em>Open Agenda</em><br><br><em>“Those who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it.”</em>- George Santayana<br><br>Set at the genesis of the regime now hailed as the Third Reich, the German Empire in 1933 is not a friendly place. The Reichstag Fire not only interred any shreds of parliamentary democracy but also inflamed the emotions that the people had until then internalized against the November Criminals. The incompetency of the Weimar Republic and the humiliating Treaty of Versailles culminated in popular resentment of the Social Democrats and Communists, eventually leading to the creation of Nazi Germany.<br><br>The committee convenes on March 23, 1933, a day after the passing of the watershed Enabling Act in the Kroll Opera House. Plagued by turmoil on both domestic and foreign soil, and threatened by arrogant upstarts, Germany's fate, hanging by a thread, lies in your hands. A simulation of perhaps the most cataclysmic regime in history, the Reich requires ministers to deal with pressing issues while framing innovative directives that free Germany from the shackles of its past.<br><br>As ministers, it is your responsibility to hold key discussions on rebuilding the economy, developing new technology, formulating foreign policy and military doctrines, as well as mobilizing resources and preparing for any conflict that threatens the empire. To this end, the Fuhrer himself has declared a state of Gleichshaltung, and expects nothing less than pure genius.<br><br>Keeping basic realism and proper justification in mind, you are invited to take Germany on the path you see fit. In a dynamic and demanding committee, we ask for dedication to this simulation and sincerity in doing justice to the weight of history that lies upon you. At every step of the way, you shall be engaged with intricate crises that aim to test your research, critical analysis, logical reasoning and leadership to the fullest.<br><br>In the Fuhrer's name, you are hereby charged with eliminating all who seek to make us flounder. With restoring Germany to its former glory. With making the Fatherland soar unfettered to ever greater heights.</p>

				<p>Agenda: <em>Khmer Rouge, Crimes Against Humanity</em><br><br>With the end of the world war, the global community was faced with a formidable task of ensuring a set of rights to every individual that would guarantee them a life with dignity and protect them from atrocities witnessed during the world war. These rights came to be known as Human rights. Yet, as a global society, we have failed in this regard. Thousands have gone hungry, homeless, helpless, for years. Families have collapsed. The rights of thousands, maybe millions, have been ripped away. And we have stood by, silent and unmoving. This entire crisis, these atrocities, can all be summed up in two words: Khmer Rouge.<br><br>The French left Cambodia, along with its haphazardly stitched borders, to doom into a conflict-riddled future. With the advent of Khmer rouge in Cambodia- the communist party of Kampuchea- it wouldn’t be long before it spreads all over Indo-China. Having an ideology of extreme Marxism and xenophobia Khmer rouge has shown its true brutality by destroying the lives of its own people.<br><br>The Khmer Rouge began as a guerrilla communist movement in north-eastern Cambodia during the 1960s. The group gained legitimacy when Cambodia’s deposed head of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, turned to them for support after a coup stripped him of his authority. During this period, several parties vied for power in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge used this chaos to establish support among rural communities. With the support of the rural poor, the Khmer Rouge eventually managed to take control of Cambodia’s capital city, Phnom Penh, in 1975.<br><br>The situation is built over several key components, each of which need to be addressed separately. The first of these is the colossal humanitarian crisis that has broken out in the region. Food shortages, extra judicial killings and malnutrition are just the tip of the iceberg. The second key component causing the crisis would be the extreme Marxist and xenophobic ideology that is being propagated by the Khmers.<br><br>The third key component to be considered would be the political instability in Cambodia which served as a platform for the Khmers to come into power and later causing gross human rights violations in the region. These issues, to name a few, along with other important factors are interlinked, sustaining each other in a vicious, never ending cycle that spirals towards chaos and entropy. Hundreds of thousands have starved to death many more are dying as you read this. Last year, the Khmer Rouge’s leader, Pol Pot, initiated a new wave of purges. He targets any political dissidents as enemies of the state.<br><br>Today executions are widespread throughout the country, and the Khmer Rouge has engaged in conflicts outside of its borders as well. Citizens of Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam have all fallen victim to the Khmer Rouge’s brutality. The brutal reign of the Khmer Rouge has taken the lives of countless innocent Cambodians and others in the region through executions and starvation in the rice fields. Those who have not died are subjected to horrible daily working conditions and are routinely separated from their loved ones.<br><br>This past April, the President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, accurately described the Khmer Rouge a “the worst violator of human rights in the world.” The international community must come together in order to create a definitive plan of action to combat the evils of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, and protect the lives of innocent Cambodians. The question of the decade still stands as; will we, as the United Nations, truly be able to tackle the conflict that has taken the lives of thousands of citizens of the world and risked the safety of millions more?</p>

				<p>Agenda: <em>Structural reformation of the United Nations Security Council with special emphasis on Article 27</em><br><br>The Sixth Committee is the primary forum for the consideration of legal questions in the General Assembly. All of the United Nations Member States are entitled to representation on the Sixth Committee as one of the main committees of the General Assembly. Every member of the committee is obligated to promote the improvement of international law. Throughout its existence, the Sixth committee has made many important contributions to the international community’s understanding of international law, the necessity of human rights and the promotion of fundamental freedoms. The committee has played a significant role in influencing the world’s understanding of International law and code.<br><br>Through this committee, we want to explore and characterize the essential issues pertaining to the reformation of the Security Council, based on differing international perspectives. Foreign policy has evolved into a diverse and dynamic network, and we expect our delegates to factor this into their deliberations.<br><br>The Security Council plays an undeniably significant role in ensuring international peace and security, however, in recent years, the global community is becoming increasingly skeptical of the functioning of the Council, and the ideals it espouses. Questions about its ‘undemocratic’ structure and relevance in light of the emergence of strong international bodies such as the European Union and the Arab League are floating about, and we believe these issues must be defined and characterized at the earliest, so as to prevent the exacerbation of the situation we find ourselves in.<br><br>According to this, each member of the Security Council has one vote. Decisions on procedural matters require a minimum of nine ‘yes’ votes. Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters require a minimum of nine ‘yes’ votes including the concurring votes of the permanent members. Any member that is a party to a dispute must abstain from voting. Except for votes on procedural questions which are determined by a simple majority, action cannot be taken on an issue that is brought before the Security Council if any one of the permanent members vote ‘no’ on a draft resolution. The ability of a permanent member to stop a draft resolution from being adopted by voting ‘no’ is called the “veto power.”</p>

				<p>Greetings delegates!<br><br>From transforming geo-political relations, to issues like climate change: our world is ever-changing in incomprehensible, unpredictable ways. As citizens of an increasingly connected world, it becomes our responsibility to create and to understand positive change, an ability that cannot develop if we give in to ignorance.<br><br>Sanskriti Model United Nations, for six years now, has strived to create an atmosphere that is stimulating- encouraging students from not just across India, but from across the world, to be a part of the process of debating, negotiating and solution making.<br><br>We, as members of the Secretariat, will ensure that as you walk into committee, you are provided with the unique opportunity to learn: not just from your Directors and delegates, but from the very experience of representing the interests of nations you may never have heard of and the plight of peoples you have not yet associated with. This is because at SMUN, we understand that unless we participate in the dynamic process of learning, unless we make the choice of keeping in sync with the reality of our times, and unless we choose to be accommodative in a world that is gradually losing its ability to accept diversity, we can hardly create a global community where the idea of collaboration dictates our solution-making process.<br><br>Alexander Humboldt once said the most dangerous worldview is that of those who have not viewed the world.<br><br>This April, we invite you to view the world. We invite you to learn. We ask you to be change-makers.<br><br>Welcome to the sixth edition of the Sanskriti Model United Nations Conference 2017. We look forward to hosting you.<br><br>Yours truly,<br>Jiya Dhillon<br>Secretary General</p>

				<p>Greetings delegates,<br><br>It is both my honour and privilege to welcome you to the Sanskriti Model United Nations Conference 2017. One of the first to start crisis committees in India; Sanskriti has a long tradition of simulating historic bodies that are unconventional yet extremely relevant to the shaping of global politics. Geared towards the development of a knowledge base, they also help the delegates who are participating in it, understand issues through a wider prism. This year at SMUN, we are convenin committees ranging from Cabinets like the German Reich as well as a Summit of States before the WW1 or the NATO.<br><br>We are committed to ensuring that the delegates will have a rewarding experience, putting them through situations that bring the best out of them. The crisis arcs have been set up in a way that is engaging, dynamic, exciting and most importantly, a learning experience for all delegates involved.<br><br>In this way, we hope to sharpen essential skills like critical analysis, logical reasoning and spontaneous reaction; making you into better debaters overall.<br><br>Regards,<br>Rohan Dabas<br>Director General Crisis</p>

				<br>
				<p>Greetings delegates,<br><br>Welcome to the 6<sup>th</sup> edition of Sanskriti Model United Nations<br><br>When confronted by the tumultuous times of the 21st Century, we increasingly realise the urgency with which the art of diplomatic manoeuvring needs to be mastered and adopted by all nations and leaders. Wars and military action, annexation of territories and controlling peoples through indoctrination and subjugation can never be the solution for lasting peace and development. In order to prevent the world from descending into chaos, the only way forward has to be engaging with all - irrespective of their beliefs and value systems and partaking in the exercise of making negotiations and counter-negotiations directed towards ameliorating the deteriorating state of our world.<br><br>This belief is shared by the SMUN Secretariat, as we endeavour to navigate through some of the biggest blunders in history, by viewing the world through the imperialist eyes of the then leaders, while simultaneously attempting to tackle present-day issues such as illegal drug trafficking, reformation of the Security Council and the expansion of NATO, among others.<br><br>We, the students, are the leaders of tomorrow. Ostensibly then, the responsibility of creating a world that is unimpeded by parochial deterrents and narrow self interests, a world that we would be proud of, lies on our shoulders. For this, intellectually stimulating activities such as MUN, you would agree, serve as a great stepping stone.<br><br>I cannot wait to confront the multitudinous moral, ethical while at the same time - administrative, political and legal quandaries with you at the diplomatic parlays unfolding at the SMUN this April.<br><br>Warm regards<br><br>Arshia Roy<br>Director General, General Assembly</p>

				<p>Welcome delegates,<br><br>It is with great pleasure that I am extending the felicitations of the secretariat to you.<br><br>Every MUN addressal seems to have the same format of a Latin law dialogue, a googled quote from a historically worshipped man, and an unwarranted claim to being the best conference in the city. However, Sanskriti Model United Nations strives to be different. We wish to encourage delegates to create their own quotes, question historical figures, and subsequently work towards being the best versions of themselves. Model United Nations can teach you a lot about history, geopolitics, and even yourself, but only if you're brave enough to let this activity consume you.<br><br>It is your support and belief in the importance of Model United Nations that drives the secretariat of Sanskriti MUN to uphold a high-quality conference. Whether you're participating to gain knowledge, express your opinion about topics that are beyond small talk, or to win a gavel: Sanskriti MUN promises to be an enriching experience for all.<br><br>Welcome to the first step of becoming the change you want to see; welcome to Sanskriti Model United Nations 2017!<br><br>Cordially,<br>Anoushka Chandra<br>Director General Conference</p>
